<https://is.muni.cz/auth/th/n28hw>

### Abstract

This thesis deals with gathering metrics about resource usage in systems with
heterogenous infrastructure, specifically MetaCentrum. It describes concepts
of making computing resources available through different technologies. It
explains common issues in monitoring, ie. metric gathering, saving and saved
data management. The thesis identifies which metrics are relevant for resource
usage monitoring in heterogenous environments. The goal of the thesis is to
design, implement and test monitoring solution for MetaCentrum infrastructure.
